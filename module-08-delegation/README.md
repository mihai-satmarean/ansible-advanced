# Module 8: Delegation - Lab Environment

## Overview
This module focuses on Ansible delegation capabilities, allowing tasks to be executed on different hosts than the target hosts, enabling complex orchestration patterns and distributed automation workflows.

## Lab Structure
- **Duration**: 40 minutes total
- **Labs**: 2 hands-on exercises
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced
- **Prerequisites**: Understanding of Ansible inventories, host patterns, and basic networking concepts

## Learning Objectives
By completing these labs, participants will:
- Understand delegation concepts and use cases
- Implement task delegation to specific hosts
- Configure delegation with facts gathering and variable handling
- Design complex orchestration workflows using delegation
- Implement load balancer and database delegation patterns
- Handle delegation in multi-environment scenarios

## Lab Environment Requirements
- Multiple host entries in inventory (simulated with localhost)
- Understanding of service orchestration patterns
- Basic knowledge of load balancers and databases
- Network connectivity concepts

## Labs Overview

### Lab 8.1: Delegation Fundamentals (20 minutes)
- Understanding delegation concepts and syntax
- Implementing basic task delegation
- Working with delegated facts and variables
- Creating delegation patterns for common scenarios

### Lab 8.2: Advanced Delegation Patterns (20 minutes)
- Implementing complex orchestration workflows
- Load balancer and service registration delegation
- Database and storage delegation patterns
- Multi-environment delegation strategies

## Expected Outcomes
After completing this module, participants will be able to:
- Design and implement delegation-based automation workflows
- Create complex orchestration patterns using delegation
- Handle cross-host dependencies and coordination
- Implement service registration and load balancer patterns
- Design scalable delegation architectures for enterprise environments
