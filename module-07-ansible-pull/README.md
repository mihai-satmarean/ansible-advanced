# Module 7: Ansible Pull - Lab Environment

## Overview
This module focuses on Ansible Pull methodology, a decentralized approach to configuration management where target nodes pull their configurations from a central repository rather than being pushed to from a control node.

## Lab Structure
- **Duration**: 45 minutes total
- **Labs**: 2 hands-on exercises
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced
- **Prerequisites**: Understanding of Git, SSH keys, and basic Ansible concepts

## Learning Objectives
By completing these labs, participants will:
- Understand the differences between push and pull models
- Configure and deploy ansible-pull setups
- Implement automated pull-based configuration management
- Set up monitoring and logging for pull operations
- Design scalable pull-based automation architectures

## Lab Environment Requirements
- Git repository access (GitHub/GitLab)
- SSH key authentication
- Cron/systemd timer capabilities
- Network connectivity to Git repositories
- Basic understanding of scheduling systems

## Labs Overview

### Lab 7.1: Ansible Pull Fundamentals (25 minutes)
- Setting up Git repository for pull configurations
- Configuring ansible-pull command and options
- Implementing basic pull-based playbook execution
- Setting up automated scheduling with cron

### Lab 7.2: Advanced Pull Strategies (20 minutes)
- Implementing secure pull configurations
- Setting up distributed pull architectures
- Monitoring and logging pull operations
- Handling failures and recovery scenarios

## Expected Outcomes
After completing this module, participants will be able to:
- Design and implement pull-based configuration management
- Set up automated, scheduled configuration pulls
- Monitor and troubleshoot pull operations
- Scale pull-based automation across large infrastructures
